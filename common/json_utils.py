"""Utility helpers for producing JSON-serialisable structures.

The crawler stack frequently has to deal with third-party libraries that
return complex Python objects (for example ``lxml`` elements or datetime
instances).  Downstream services such as the memory agent expect plain JSON
payloads, so ``make_json_safe`` normalises arbitrarily nested objects into a
format that ``json.dumps`` can consume without raising errors.
