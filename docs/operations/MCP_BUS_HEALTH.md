# MCP Bus Health and Diagnostics

This document explains the MCP Bus `/health` and `/ready` endpoints, how health is reported, how to interpret results, and developer guidance for adding tests covering health behaviour.

## Overview

The MCP Bus exposes a machine-readable health endpoint at `/health` (HTTP GET). It performs best-effort probes against registered agents' `/health` endpoints and returns a composite status that includes per-agent details, circuit breaker state, and operational issues.

- Endpoint: `GET http://<mcp_host>:<mcp_port>/health`
- Readiness endpoint: `GET /ready` returns `{"ready": true|false}` (service ready flag).

The endpoint is intended for operational checks, health monitoring, and load balancers.

## Response schema

A typical `/health` JSON body includes:

- `timestamp`: Unix timestamp
- `overall_status`: `healthy` | `degraded` | `unhealthy`
- `registered_agents`: number of agents known to the bus
- `circuit_breaker_active`: boolean (true if one or more breakers are open)
- `agent_details`: list of per-agent objects:
  - `agent`: agent name
  - `status`: `healthy` | `degraded` | `unhealthy` | `unreachable` | `unknown`
  - `response_time`: seconds (float, optional)
  - `status_code`: HTTP response code (optional)
  - `error`: error message on probe failure (optional)
- `issues`: array of strings describing any global issues

Example:

```json
{
  "timestamp": 1690000000.1234,
  "overall_status": "degraded",
  "registered_agents": 3,
  "circuit_breaker_active": false,
  "agent_details": [
    {"agent": "analyst", "status": "healthy", "response_time": 0.042},
    {"agent": "synthesizer", "status": "unreachable", "error": "connect timeout"}
  ],
  "issues": ["One or more registered agents reported unhealthy or unreachable"]
}
```

## How the probe works (developer notes)

- The MCP Bus engine performs a best-effort HTTP GET to `<agent_address>/health` (1s probe timeout) for each registered agent when `requests` is available.
- If `requests` is not importable, agent statuses will be set to `unknown` and the bus-level `overall_status` may be `degraded` if agents are expected.
- Any non-2xx response, JSON parse error, or network error will be reported as `unhealthy`/`unreachable` and will mark the bus `overall_status` as `degraded`.
- Circuit breakers are included in the health report (see `circuit_breaker_active` boolean).

## Operational usage (user)

- Quick health check (local):

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8017/health | jq
```

- Confirm readiness:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8017/ready && echo "MCP Bus ready"
```

- The repository provides a multi-service health check script used by operators in `infrastructure/systemd/health_check.sh` which already includes `mcp_bus` in the default services list.

## Monitoring & alerting

- Add an alert on `overall_status != "healthy"` for key services. For example, alert when `mcp_bus` reports `degraded` or when a specific agent is `unreachable` for more than 2 check cycles.

- Integrate the endpoint into your Prometheus blackbox exporter or a simple cron job for internal monitoring.

## Testing (developer)

### Unit tests

- The engine-level logic is in `agents/mcp_bus/mcp_bus_engine.py`.
- Unit tests for the engine live in `tests/agents/mcp_bus/test_health.py` and cover:
  - Unreachable agents (requests exceptions)
  - Agents reporting `degraded` statuses (non-`healthy` JSON)

Run the unit tests in the canonical environment:

```bash
conda run -n justnews-py312 pytest -q tests/agents/mcp_bus/test_health.py
```

### Integration tests

- Integration tests exercise the FastAPI app (TestClient) and live at `tests/agents/mcp_bus/test_health_integration.py`.
- These tests patch `requests.get` to simulate agent responses and monkeypatch `agents.mcp_bus.main.notify_gpu_orchestrator` to prevent external network calls during app startup.

Run integration tests:

```bash
conda run -n justnews-py312 pytest -q tests/agents/mcp_bus/test_health_integration.py
```

### Writing tests

- Prefer `monkeypatch` to patch `agents.mcp_bus.mcp_bus_engine.requests.get` when simulating agent responses.
- For FastAPI endpoint tests use `fastapi.testclient.TestClient(app)` and ensure the engine state is clean before each test by clearing `tools.get_engine().agents` and `circuit_breaker_state`.
- Patch `agents.mcp_bus.main.notify_gpu_orchestrator` (returning `True`) in tests that instantiate the `TestClient` to avoid network calls during the app lifespan.

Example test patterns are included in the `tests/agents/mcp_bus` directory.

## Troubleshooting

- If `/health` reports `unreachable` for a known agent:
  - Verify the agent is registered (GET `/agents`).
  - Check the agent's own `/health` endpoint directly (curl).
  - Confirm network/firewall rules allow `MCP Bus` to connect to the agent address.

- If health checks appear slow, check whether `requests` is falling back to slow DNS lookups or whether the probe timeout is too large; the probe timeout defaults to 1.0s per agent.

If you want, I can add example Prometheus alert rules and a short Grafana panel for MCP Bus health. Let me know if you'd like that included.
