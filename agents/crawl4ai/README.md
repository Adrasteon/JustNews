Crawl4AI agent (JustNews)
=================================

This directory contains the helper used to run the local Crawl4AI HTTP bridge as
a managed JustNews agent. The service is started via the instance systemd
template `justnews@.service` as `justnews@crawl4ai`.

Files
- `main.py` – agent entry point invoked by the `justnews-start-agent.sh` helper. It launches the FastAPI bridge (`agents.c4ai.server:app`) using `uvicorn`.
- `__init__.py` – package marker.

How it's managed
- Use the canonical flow to start/enable the agent (recommended):
  - `sudo ./infrastructure/systemd/reset_and_start.sh`
  - or: `sudo ./infrastructure/systemd/scripts/enable_all.sh fresh`

Configuration
- Configure runtime variables in `/etc/justnews/global.env` or `/etc/justnews/crawl4ai.env`.
  Important variables include `CRAWL4AI_HOST`, `CRAWL4AI_PORT`, `CRAWL4AI_USE_LLM`, and `CRAWL4AI_MODEL_CACHE_DIR`.

  Security:
  - `CRAWLER_API_TOKEN`: when set, the `/crawl` endpoint requires this token to be supplied via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` or `X-Api-Token` header. This is optional (if unset, endpoints are open for compatibility).

Notes
- The repository previously included a standalone systemd unit `crawl4ai-bridge.service` for ad-hoc testing; the canonical deployment uses `justnews@crawl4ai` so the agent participates in ordering, dependency gating, and health checks.

If you need me to update `/etc/justnews/global.env` examples or the unit template to pin an absolute Python path, tell me which option you prefer (global.env PYTHON_BIN vs. absolute ExecStart in unit).
