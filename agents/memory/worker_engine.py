"""
Worker Engine - Background Task Coordination
===========================================

Responsibilities:
- Provide a lightweight executor for background tasks
- Hold references to core engines for delegated work
- Expose helpers for scheduling asynchronous jobs

Architecture:
- ThreadPoolExecutor with configurable worker count
- Async-friendly initialization and shutdown hooks
