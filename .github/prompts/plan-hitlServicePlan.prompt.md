Continuation Plan — HITL Access & Crawler Integration

Summary:
- Goal: Ensure the Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) annotator UI is available, seeded with candidates from the crawler, monitored, and safe to roll out into staging/production.
- Current state: HITL API serves the static UI at `/` and `/static/*`. The crawler builds candidate payloads and posts them to `/api/candidates`. Recent changes applied: `CandidateEvent.id` now defaults to `None` (prevents 422), crawler payload builder implemented, and automated tests added and passing.

Pending Tasks (prioritised):
1) CI + test coverage (High priority)
   - Why: ensure regressions are caught on PRs and remote CI runs the test suite.
   - Steps:
     - Add a minimal GitHub Actions workflow to run `pytest` on pushes/PRs (use the project's `environment.yml` or `requirements.txt` to install deps).
     - Run the new tests in CI and iterate if environment issues appear.
   - Verification: GitHub Actions shows green on this branch; tests pass.

2) Documentation and environment knobs (High priority)
   - Why: operators need clear guidance to configure the HITL service in different environments.
   - Steps:
     - Update `infrastructure/systemd/examples/hitl_service.env.example` with the key envs and brief descriptions: `HITL_SERVICE_ADDRESS`, `HITL_DB_PATH`, `ENABLE_HITL_PIPELINE`, `HITL_STATS_INTERVAL_SECONDS`, `HITL_FAILURE_BACKOFF_SECONDS`, forwarding knobs (`HITL_FORWARD_AGENT`, `HITL_FORWARD_TOOL`).
     - Add `agents/hitl_service/README.md` explaining how to override DB path, enable/disable pipeline, and where the UI is served.
   - Verification: README present and example env includes knobs.

3) Ingest-forward integration test (Medium priority)
   - Why: validate the end-to-end label->ingest-forward path without requiring a live MCP Bus.
   - Steps:
     - Add a pytest that patches `mcp_client.call_tool` and exercises `store_label` / `dispatch_ingest` to ensure the code path constructs the right payload and handles retries/backoff.
     - Optionally add a small test that simulates `HITL_FORWARD_ENABLED=true` behavior with a dummy MCP client.
   - Verification: tests assert that `dispatch_ingest` calls `mcp_client.call_tool` and updates DB ingestion_status appropriately.

4) Controlled integration run and manual verification (Medium priority)
   - Why: verify crawler→HITL→UI→label→(ingest-forward) working in a full run.
   - Steps:
     - Run a controlled `unified_production_crawl` producing ~10 candidates from well-known domains.
     - Label a few items via the UI or programmatically (we have test coverage for programmatic labeling).
     - Check `GET /api/stats`, `GET /api/next`, and `hitl_labels` and `hitl_candidates` DB rows.
   - Verification: `/api/stats` reflects expected pending/in_review counts; labeled rows appear in `hitl_labels` and ingestion forward payloads are created.

5) Operational guidance and monitoring (Low priority)
   - Why: ensure service is observable and restartable in production.
   - Steps:
     - Document health endpoints: `GET /health`, `GET /ready`, and `GET /api/stats`.
     - Add a note to `infrastructure/systemd/scripts/enable_all.sh` docs to keep installed copies in sync.
   - Verification: operators can run health checks and the startup script includes HITL.

Acceptance criteria (for merge/rollout):
- Tests: New and existing tests pass in CI.
- End-to-end: a controlled run seeds candidates into HITL and the UI exposes them.
- Docs: example env file and `agents/hitl_service/README.md` added/updated.

Notes/Assumptions:
- This plan assumes local deployment and localhost endpoints by default; change `HITL_SERVICE_ADDRESS` for remote hosts.
- The local staging DB (`agents/hitl_service/hitl_staging.db`) is intentionally ignored from git and should remain local-only.
- The crawler will only POST candidates when `ENABLE_HITL_PIPELINE` is true (default true unless overridden).

Immediate next actions (recommendation):
- Add the GitHub Actions workflow to run `pytest` on pushes/PRs. I can scaffold this now and push it to the branch.
- Prepare `agents/hitl_service/README.md` and update the example env file. If you want, I can produce these files and push them.

If you want me to proceed: tell me which immediate action to take (add CI, add docs, or run a larger integrated crawl).
