# Stage B Validation Playbook

This playbook captures the operational steps required to consider Stage B complete. Use it to track database migrations, scheduler deployment, observability roll-out, QA cadences, and the proofs needed for exit criteria.

## 1. Database and Ingestion Plumbing

- Apply migration `database/migrations/003_stage_b_ingestion.sql` to your Stage B database. Confirm `collection_timestamp`, `normalized_url`, `url_hash`, metadata JSON columns, and the `embedding` vector field exist. Use `bash scripts/ops/apply_stage_b_migration.sh [DB_URL] --record` to apply and log the operation; command output is preserved under `logs/operations/migrations/` for audit.
- Verify the ingestion agent populates new fields:
  - Invoke `agents/memory/tools.save_article` via unit tests (`tests/agents/memory/test_save_article.py`) or an ad-hoc ingestion to confirm `collection_timestamp`, dedupe hashes, review flags, and embeddings reach the database.
  - Inspect a sample row with `SELECT title, normalized_url, url_hash, needs_review, collection_timestamp FROM articles ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 5;`.
- Document the migration execution (timestamp, operator, target database) in your ops log or ticket system.

## 2. Scheduler Bring-Up

- Ensure `config/crawl_schedule.yaml` matches the target source cohorts and governance metadata.
- Deploy the systemd timer:
  - Install `infrastructure/systemd/scripts/run_crawl_schedule.sh` and the associated unit/timer under `/etc/systemd/system/` (e.g., `justnews-crawl-scheduler.service` / `.timer`).
  - Set environment values in `/etc/justnews/global.env`: `SERVICE_DIR`, `JUSTNEWS_PYTHON`, `CRAWL_SCHEDULE_PATH` (optional), and overrides for output paths if needed.
  - Ensure the analytics directory exists and is writable by the scheduler user: `sudo mkdir -p "$SERVICE_DIR/logs/analytics" && sudo chown -R <scheduler-user>:<scheduler-group> "$SERVICE_DIR/logs"`.
  - Run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable --now justnews-crawl-scheduler.timer`.
- Capture dry-run evidence:
  - Execute `JUSTNEWS_PYTHON scripts/ops/run_crawl_schedule.py --dry-run --max-target 100` to show planned batches without invoking the crawler.
- Capture live-run evidence:
  - Tail the timer journal (`journalctl -u justnews-crawl-scheduler.service -n 200`) and archive the latest `logs/analytics/crawl_scheduler_state.json` snapshot.

## 3. Observability Roll-Out

- Prometheus textfile metrics are written to `logs/analytics/crawl_scheduler.prom`. Register (or symlink) this file with your node exporter textfile collector; on systemd hosts run:
  ```bash
  sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/node_exporter/textfile_collector
  sudo chown adra:adra /var/lib/node_exporter/textfile_collector
  sudo sed -i 's|^CRAWL_SCHEDULER_METRICS=.*|CRAWL_SCHEDULER_METRICS=/var/lib/node_exporter/textfile_collector/crawl_scheduler.prom|' /etc/justnews/global.env
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart justnews-crawl-scheduler.service
  ```
  Confirm `crawl_scheduler.prom` appears under `/var/lib/node_exporter/textfile_collector/` and that Prometheus scrapes the new target.
- Stage B embedding metrics:
  - `common/stage_b_metrics.StageBMetrics` exports `justnews_stage_b_embedding_total{status=...}` and `justnews_stage_b_embedding_latency_seconds{cache=...}`.
  - Ensure the memory agent’s Prometheus endpoint or push gateway path includes these counters.
- Dashboard updates:
  - Create panels for extraction/ingestion outcomes, embedding status (success, error, model_unavailable), latency percentiles, duplicate counts, and scheduler lag (`justnews_crawler_scheduler_lag_seconds`).
  - Add per-language filters where possible to highlight QA sampling needs.
- Alert thresholds (recommended):
  - Embedding errors > 3% over 15 minutes.
  - Scheduler lag > 5 minutes for two consecutive runs.
  - `needs_review` ratio > 10% for any source cohort.

## 4. Human QA and Governance Cadence

- Establish a weekly sampling review: pull `needs_review` articles per language/region into `logs/governance/crawl_terms_audit.md`. Use the provided template (cohort, URL, terms status, QA notes, follow-up) and attach supporting captures when anomalies appear.
- Track source terms-of-use and rate-limit acknowledgements in the same log; note remediation for violations.
- Confirm the success history file (`logs/analytics/crawl_scheduler_success.json`) is rotated and archived for audits.

## 5. Integration and Regression Validation

- Run targeted tests:
  - `conda run -n justnews-v2-py312 python -m pytest tests/agents/crawler/test_extraction.py tests/agents/memory/test_save_article.py -q`
  - `conda run -n justnews-v2-py312 python -m pytest tests/scripts/test_run_crawl_schedule_integration.py -q`
- Optional end-to-end smoke: trigger the scheduler with `--no-wait` and ensure articles flow into the database with embeddings present.
- Record test outputs (command, environment, timestamp) in the bring-up ticket.

## 6. Exit Evidence Checklist

Collect the following artifacts before declaring Stage B complete:

- [ ] Migration 003 applied, schema verified.
- [ ] Hourly scheduler active, last-run state JSON archived.
- [ ] Prometheus scrape showing embedding counters and scheduler gauges over a 24-hour window.
- [ ] Grafana (or equivalent) screenshot highlighting extraction success > 95% and `needs_review` < 5%.
- [ ] Duplicate suppression validated via sample queries (`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM articles WHERE status='duplicate'` or equivalent metrics) with results archived under `logs/operations/evidence/`.
- [ ] Human QA sampling log entries covering at least two cohorts.
- [ ] Test suite outputs attached to the change record.

Maintain this document alongside change requests so future operators can rapidly revalidate Stage B after upgrades or incident recoveries.
