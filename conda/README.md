Conda packaging recipes and helper scripts =======================================

This directory contains packaging recipes and helper scripts for building conda packages that are required by this
project but are not available as compatible conda packages for our supported Python version(s).

protobuf (python) recipe ------------------------

Location: conda/recipes/protobuf

Purpose: build a python `protobuf` package compatible with Python 3.12 in environments where conda-forge does not
provide a matching Python wheel.

How to use (locally)

1. Ensure `conda-build` or `mamba` (and `conda-build`) are installed in your
base environment.

1. From this repo root run:

```bash

# build into /tmp/conda-bld (or the conda-build configured output dir)

conda build conda/recipes/protobuf

```bash

1. If the build succeeds it will produce a conda package which can be installed
into your environment using `conda install --use-local protobuf`.

Contributing to conda-forge ---------------------------

If this recipe is useful, open a PR to the conda-forge `staged-recipes` repo following their contribution guidelines.
The recipe in this project is a starting point; maintainers may request updates (source urls, patches, pinning of
dependencies, etc.) before the final recipe is accepted into conda-forge.

Notes -----

- The recipe intentionally tries to use the upstream PyPI sdist as the source
and uses pip to build the wheel inside the conda-build environment so the compiled extension matches the local Python
ABI.

- Building protobuf can require a non-trivial build toolchain; CI or developer
machines must have the appropriate compilers and dependencies available.
