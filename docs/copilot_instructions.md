# Copilot / Assistant Instructions (project canonical)

This document formalizes the model-and-assistant guidelines for the JustNews repository. Keep this tracked and visible
to contributors; it complements the private `.copilot-instructions` file which individuals may keep locally.

Purpose ------- Make the repository's expectations explicit when automated assistants (GitHub Copilot, other LLM
helpers, or CI agents) suggest or apply fixes and edits.

Python runtime (project default) -------------------------------- The canonical project Python environment is a conda
environment named `${CANONICAL_ENV:-justnews-py312}`.

When invoking scripts or running code snippets in documentation, prefer either:

- `conda run -n ${CANONICAL_ENV:-justnews-py312} python <script>` or

- `PYTHON_BIN=/home/adra/miniconda3/envs/${CANONICAL_ENV:-justnews-py312}/bin/python <script>`

When adding examples or CI configuration, prefer using `${CANONICAL_ENV:-justnews-py312}` by default (unless a different
environment is explicitly requested). ------------------

- Always consult `/etc/justnews/global.env`(or the configured`SERVICE_DIR`variant) for runtime configuration such as`PYTHON_BIN` before making changes that affect runtime, startup or agent behavior.

- If documentation or generated startup scripts introduce a new `PYTHON_BIN`path, update`global.env` (and include a
  human-reviewed note in the PR) — do not hardcode environment-dependent interpreter paths in unrelated source files.

- Assistants should prefer to update `global.env`(or`infrastructure/systemd/examples/justnews.env.example`) rather than leaving users with out-of-sync example values.

- Automation exists to help keep `PYTHON_BIN`present:`infrastructure/systemd/scripts/ensure_global_python_bin.sh`(run at
  startup) and a repo validation script`infrastructure/scripts/validate-global-env.sh` (CI-friendly). When proposing
  runtime changes, update both the example and the global env, and ensure a validation step is added or existing
  validation passes.

Core rules (must follow) ------------------------

- Do not create or commit secrets (API keys, credentials, tokens) into the repository.

- Any change that affects authentication, authorization, admin endpoints, data export, or privacy must include an explanation, tests, and an audit plan.

- Provide tests for new functionality or changes to existing behavior where practical.

Behavioral guidelines for assistants -----------------------------------

- Limit the scope of edits in a single commit/PR; prefer small, reviewable changes.

- Prefer writing clear, readable code with early returns and small helper functions.

- Add or update `docs/` for any non-trivial change in behavior, API surface, or operational processes.

Package installation policy ---------------------------

- When performing package installs for this project, prefer `conda install`or`mamba install`targeting the canonical
  conda environment (`${CANONICAL_ENV:-justnews-py312}`) and`conda-forge`/official channels.

- Only use `pip`as a last resort when a required package or specific wheel is not available via conda; if`pip`is used,
  document the reason and pin the exact version/wheel in the PR and add an update to`environment.yml` where appropriate.

- Avoid modifying the runtime environment using `pip`in CI or system-wide installation steps; prefer conda operations so
  environments remain reproducible. If`pip` must be used in CI, ensure a clear justification is recorded in the change
  and validations are added.

Testing & CI -----------

- Assistants should add tests or update tests when changing functionality. If the change has unavoidable infra
  dependencies (e.g., Redis, MariaDB, Chroma), gate tests behind environment flags and document how to run them locally.

Security & privacy details -------------------------

- Never output or expand private / system-level files (e.g., `/etc/`, private keys) into tracked files or PRs.

- If a change requires secrets for local testing, document the expected local environment variables and keep them out of tracked files.

Review & escalation -------------------

- For architectural or large refactors, include a short design rationale and request review from the relevant subsystem owners.

- When uncertain about safety or side effects (especially in “synthesizer”, “critic”, or anything producing public content), escalate to a human reviewer before merging.

Recommended local file (.copilot-instructions) --------------------------------------------- Keep a short, private
`.copilot- instructions` file at the repo root (gitignored) for any personal preferences and developer-specific
guardrails. See `.gitignore`which already includes`.copilot-instructions`.

Examples --------

- Good: Small bugfix + unit test + updated docs + short PR message explaining the rationale.

- Bad: Large sweeping refactor to security/auth code pushed without tests or a design note.

Where automation can help ------------------------

- Reformatting, import cleanup, unit test scaffolding, small bugfixes, and doc generation (provided tests remain green).

Contact & ownership -------------------

- Keep a link to the teams or owners for major modules in the PRs. Codeowners (if present) should be requested to review sensitive or production-impacting changes.

Maintainers can update this file to reflect evolving policies.
