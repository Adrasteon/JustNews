# Git hooks for JustNews (local developer helpers)

The repository includes a small set of optional git hooks that are intended as developer helpers. They are intentionally non-mandatory and opt-in.

Why use them?
- Encourage test consistency by recommending the `scripts/dev/pytest.sh` wrapper that runs tests inside the `${CANONICAL_ENV:-justnews-py312}` conda environment.
- Optionally run a very quick unit smoke test on `pre-push` to catch obvious breakages before pushing to remote (non-default behavior).

Installation

From the repository root run:

```bash
./scripts/dev/install_hooks.sh
```

The installer copies scripts from `scripts/dev/git-hooks/` into `.git/hooks` and marks them executable.

Hook behavior

- `pre-push`: prints a recommendation to use the pytest wrapper. If you set `GIT_STRICT_TEST_HOOK=1` in your shell, the hook will also run a quick unit smoke test (`pytest -k "not integration" --maxfail=1`) and abort the push on failure.

FAQ

- Q: Are hooks enforced in CI? A: No — hooks are local, opt-in developer helpers and not enforced by CI. Server-side or branch protection policies are recommended for enforced checks.
- Q: How do I bypass the conda recommendation? A: Set `ALLOW_ANY_PYTEST_ENV=1` to bypass the local conftest check (useful for experimental runs or debugging).
