Grafana provisioning (docs)
---------------------------------

This folder contains example Grafana provisioning files that can be used to auto-provision
dashboards and datasources in a Grafana instance. These are documentation examples and must
be wired into your Grafana container or server (for example by copying them into /etc/grafana/provisioning/)

How to use
1. Copy `datasources.yml` to Grafana `/etc/grafana/provisioning/datasources/` and adjust the Prometheus URL or authentication block to match your deployment.
2. Copy `dashboards.yml` to `/etc/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/` and copy the `dashboards/` folder contents (for example, `docs/grafana/editorial-harness-dashboard.json`) to the configured path.
3. Restart Grafana or reload provisioning to pick up the new dashboards and datasources.
4. For the Stage 4 harness specifically, see `docs/grafana/editorial-harness-wiring.md` for scrape job requirements and alert suggestions.

## JustNews production specifics

- The canonical generated dashboards for production live under `monitoring/dashboards/generated/` (`*_dashboard.json`). Each file already carries the Grafana-ready shape (no `{"dashboard": ...}` wrapper) and includes the UID that exists in the live instance:
	- `monitoring/dashboards/generated/business_metrics_dashboard.json` → UID `af5zdqbqc8xkwf` (Business Metrics Dashboard)
	- `monitoring/dashboards/generated/justnews_operations_dashboard.json` → UID `ef37elu2756o0e` (JustNews Operations Dashboard)
	- `monitoring/dashboards/generated/system_overview_dashboard.json` → UID `ef5zdqbvm17uoc` (JustNews System Overview)
- To push updates into the systemd-managed Grafana service, copy those three files into `/etc/justnews/monitoring/grafana/dashboards/` and restart `justnews-grafana.service`. Provisioning runs every 30 seconds, but a restart guarantees the reload and surfaces any validation errors in `journalctl -u justnews-grafana`.
- If you export a dashboard from the Grafana UI, strip the `{"dashboard": ...}` envelope and keep only the dashboard body with the correct `uid` before committing back into `monitoring/dashboards/generated/`. Provisioning rejects wrapped payloads with `Dashboard title cannot be empty`.
- When removing a dashboard permanently, delete the JSON file, remove the row from Grafana (`curl -X DELETE /api/dashboards/uid/<uid>` or, if RBAC blocks that, stop Grafana and prune the `dashboard` + `dashboard_provisioning` rows from `/var/lib/justnews/grafana/grafana.db` after taking a backup). This keeps the UI aligned with the curated set of dashboards tracked in Git.
