# Stage B Validation Ticket Template

## Summary
- **Objective**: `Stage B validation for <environment>`
- **Change window**: `<start-end>`
- **Owner(s)**: `<ops-oncall>`
- **Related artifacts**: `docs/operations/stage_b_validation.md`

## Preconditions
- Stage A bring-up verified ✅
- Required migrations reviewed (`database/migrations/003_stage_b_ingestion.sql`)
- Scheduler configuration confirmed (`config/crawl_schedule.yaml`)

## Execution Plan
1. Apply migration 003 to target database.
2. Enable `justnews-crawl-scheduler.timer` and monitor first live run.
3. Register Prometheus textfile exporter path for scheduler metrics.
4. Validate embedding counters/histogram in Prometheus scrape.
5. Run targeted pytest suites (crawler + memory + scheduler integration).
6. Capture QA sampling notes for needs_review cohorts.

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Migration applied; schema inspected with `SELECT` sample.
- [ ] Scheduler timer active; last run timestamp recorded.
- [ ] `logs/analytics/crawl_scheduler_state.json` archived.
- [ ] Prometheus scrape shows Stage B embedding counters and latency histogram.
- [ ] Dashboard panels updated for Stage B metrics (extraction, ingestion, embeddings, scheduler lag).
- [ ] QA sampling log updated in `logs/governance/crawl_terms_audit.md`.
- [ ] Duplicate suppression sample query executed and result captured.
- [ ] Test outputs attached (commands + timestamps).

## Evidence Log
| Item | Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Migration 003 | `<psql output or screenshot>` | Pending |
| Scheduler | `journalctl -u justnews-crawl-scheduler.service -n 200` | Pending |
| Metrics | `conda run -n justnews-v2-py312-fix python -m pytest ...` | Pending |
| Dashboard | `<Grafana panel link>` | Pending |
| QA Sampling | `logs/governance/crawl_terms_audit.md` entry | Pending |

## Rollback Plan
- Disable scheduler timer: `sudo systemctl disable --now justnews-crawl-scheduler.timer`.
- Revert migration if necessary using `database/migrations/003_stage_b_ingestion.sql` down script.
- Restore previous metrics or dashboard configuration snapshots.

## Notes
- Attach relevant screenshots/logs as ticket attachments.
- Reference the `docs/operations/stage_b_validation.md` playbook for detailed steps and thresholds.
