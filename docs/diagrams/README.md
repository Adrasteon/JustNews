# JustNews Diagrams

This folder contains a set of focused C4 diagrams that represent the JustNews agent architecture. Each diagram is intentionally scoped to reduce cross-edge clutter and make relationships easier to reason about.

Files
- `justnews_core_infra.mmd` — Core infrastructure: `mcp_bus`, `auth`, `balancer`, `gpu_orch`.
- `justnews_ingestion_pipeline.mmd` — Ingestion stage: `scout`, `c4ai`, `crawler`, `journalist`, `memory`.
- `justnews_analysis_hitl.mmd` — Analysis & HITL chain: `synthesizer`, `fact_checker`, `analyst`, `critic`, `hitl`, `chief_editor`.
- `justnews_storage_dashboard.mmd` — Storage & access: `memory`, `archive`, `dashboard`, `analytics`.
- `containers/crawler_container.mmd` — Container-level view for `crawler` showing internal subsystems.
- `containers/memory_container.mmd` — Container-level view for `memory` showing internal components: MariaDB, Chroma, embedding cache, vector engine.

Why split into multiple diagrams
- The system is heavily interconnected; a single context diagram is too dense to read. Splitting improves readability and helps focus discussions on specific parts of the pipeline.

Styling & Improvements
- Relations are color-coded by domain (Green = storage, Blue = ingestion/control, Purple = analysis) to make lines visually thicker and more color-contrasting. No direct 'weight' property is supported in the C4 mermaid syntax, so color and offset are used to increase visibility.

Usage
- Use a Mermaid live editor or GitHub’s Mermaid rendering (where available) to preview `*.mmd` files.
- If you’d like me to also export PNG/SVG assets or add these diagrams to repo-as-docs, I can add an `assets/` directory with rendered images and link them from README.

Next steps
- I can:  
  - Expand container-level diagrams to cover additional heavy agents (e.g., `synthesizer`, `analyst`, `fact_checker`).  
  - Add a single “overview” diagram that links the per-scope diagrams as a single flow with minimal connecting edges for context.  
  - Add a script to generate fallback PNGs using Mermaid CLI or GitHub Actions.
