"""Placeholder for the specialised BBC crawler.

The original implementation used a handcrafted parser for the BBC domain.  This
stub keeps the call site working while signalling to operators that the
optimised path is inactive.  When invoked it simply raises ``NotImplementedError``
so the generic crawler path can take over.
