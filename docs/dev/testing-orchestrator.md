# Testing the GPU Orchestrator (developer & CI guide)

This doc covers the recommended testing strategies for the GPU orchestrator: quick local unit/integration tests using in-memory emulators, deeper systemd-based containers for system-level testing, and CI configuration that runs tests in the canonical conda environment used by developers.

Why this matters
- The orchestrator interacts with production services (MariaDB and Redis streams) — tests should be fast and hermetic during development but there are cases where you want higher fidelity tests that exercise systemd and service behavior.

Test tiers
1. Fast unit & integration tests (local dev) — use in-memory sqlite + in-memory Redis emulator
   - Location: `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/`
   - Fast, deterministic, no external infra required
   - Use the pytest helper script to ensure you run tests inside the project's conda environment:

       ./scripts/dev/pytest.sh [pytest args]

   - The tests include helpers that map MySQL `%s` placeholders to sqlite `?` for compatibility in CI and developer runs.

2. Systemd-level local tests — optional, opt-in, higher fidelity
   - Use the repository-provided systemd-nspawn helper `scripts/dev/run_systemd_nspawn_env.sh` to create an Ubuntu-based systemd container and install `mariadb-server` and `redis-server` inside it.
   - This is useful for reproducing systemd/service unit ordering issues, DB startup ordering, or other system-level behavior that in-memory emulators won't show.
   - Steps (example):

       sudo scripts/dev/run_systemd_nspawn_env.sh create
       sudo scripts/dev/run_systemd_nspawn_env.sh start
       sudo scripts/dev/run_systemd_nspawn_env.sh install
       sudo scripts/dev/run_systemd_nspawn_env.sh shell  # to inspect and run tests in the container

   - The helper is intentionally opt-in and requires root or privilege. For teams that want easier management and clustering of system containers, consider LXD on developer machines or on self-hosted runners.

3. CI-level fidelity tests
   - The repository CI workflow has been updated to use Miniconda and create a `justnews-py312` conda environment in CI, matching local dev setups; CI now runs `pytest` inside that environment.
   - If you want true end-to-end tests hitting live Redis and MariaDB, prefer a dedicated CI job that runs on self-hosted runners capable of running systemd-nspawn or LXD (not possible on the default hosted runners due to privilege constraints). Adding such a CI job is recommended for deeper validation but needs self-hosted capabilities.

Developer ergonomics & helpers
- `scripts/dev/pytest.sh` — wrapper which runs pytest inside `justnews-py312` conda env and sets `PYTHONPATH` to the repo root. Use it for consistent local runs.
- `scripts/dev/install_hooks.sh` — installs local git hooks (from `scripts/dev/git-hooks/`) into `.git/hooks` (opt-in). The `pre-push` hook prints guidance and can optionally run a quick smoke test when `GIT_STRICT_TEST_HOOK=1`.
- `tests/conftest.py` includes a safety check that enforces that local pytest runs are in `justnews-py312` by default. CI bypasses this check; developers can bypass locally by setting `ALLOW_ANY_PYTEST_ENV=1`.

Practical commands
- Run all unit tests quickly:

      ./scripts/dev/pytest.sh -q -k "not integration"

- Run integration tests (fast in-memory harness):

      ./scripts/dev/pytest.sh -q tests/integration -q

- Run worker flow integration test specifically (smoke):

      ./scripts/dev/pytest.sh -q tests/integration/test_worker_flow.py::test_worker_claims_lease_runs_and_updates_db -q -s

Running full, real E2E tests inside a systemd-nspawn container (self-hosted runner)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have a self-hosted runner prepared (see `scripts/dev/setup_selfhosted_runner.sh`) and a running systemd-nspawn container bootstrapped (the CI workflow covers this), you can run the full E2E suite inside the container with:

```bash
# from the runner or inside the container shell
cd /root/justnews
E2E_REAL=1 PYTEST_RUNNING=1 PYTHONPATH=/root/justnews python3.12 -m pytest tests/e2e -q -s
```

The E2E tests are gated by the `E2E_REAL=1` environment variable so they won't run in standard CI or local developer runs unless explicitly enabled.

Tips & gotchas
- In-memory tests are intentionally opinionated to keep CI fast and deterministic — they simulate Redis/XGROUP semantics and map SQL placeholder differences. Use systemd-nspawn or CI self-hosted jobs only when you need production fidelity.
- When debugging a failing integration test, try:
  - Enabling more verbose pytest output (-vv or -s) and reviewing debug prints in `agents/gpu_orchestrator/worker.py` and engine logs
  - Spawning a systemd-nspawn container and running the engine against a real MariaDB inside the container to identify behaviour differences between sqlite and MariaDB

Where to add tests
- Add new unit tests in `tests/unit/` for engine methods (lease persistence, leader election mocks, reclaimer), and integration tests in `tests/integration/` for end-to-end flows (submit->claim->done, DLQ handling, reclaimer pass). Follow patterns seen in the repository for sqlite/redis emulators to remain CI-friendly.
