# Extraction Pipeline — Design and Interfaces

Overview
- Trafilatura-first extraction pipeline with layered fallbacks (readability-lxml, jusText, plain-sanitizer). The pipeline is intended to provide high-quality cleaned article text with metadata suitable for indexing and downstream consumption.

Files of interest
- `agents/crawler/extraction.py`

Pipeline stages
1. Raw HTML normalization and quick heuristics (language detection, word-count checks).
2. Primary extractor: Trafilatura — returns main text, title, and metadata.
3. Secondary extractor: Readability/JusText for cases where primary fails.
4. Plain sanitizer fallback: strip tags, basic heuristics to create a usable text.

Outputs
- `cleaned_text` (string) — main article body used for indexing and ingestion.
- `extraction_metadata` (dict) — includes extractor used, confidence, word_count, coverage stats, and `crawl4ai` provenance if available.

Quality gates
- Minimum word_count threshold for downstream ingestion.
- Flags for manual review via HITL if heuristics indicate low-confidence extraction.

Extensibility
- Extraction can consume Crawl4AI markdown output when Trafilatura underperforms for a site (profile flag to toggle).

Testing
- Regression tests with sample HTML fixtures and expected cleaned text.
- Parity tests via the `evaluation` harness comparing Trafilatura output to ground-truth.
