# Memory Agent — Design and Interfaces

Responsibilities

- Normalize and persist ingested articles into structured DBs (MariaDB) and vector stores (Chroma or alternative).

- Provide APIs for article retrieval, embedding lookup, and recall for downstream agents.

- Emit ingestion metrics and provide idempotent ingestion semantics.

Files of interest

- `agents/memory/memory_engine.py` — core ingestion logic

- `database/` — migrations and models

Ingest API (example)

- MCP call `memory.ingest_article` payload fields:

  - `site_id` (str), `url` (str), `title` (str), `cleaned_text` (str),

  - `extraction_metadata` (dict), `source_html_path` (str, optional),

  - `ingest_meta` (dict: source, run_id, provenance)

Processing steps

1. Validate and normalise payload (ensure `site_id` is string, truncate extreme fields).

2. Compute or fetch embeddings for `cleaned_text` and persist to vector DB.

3. Persist structured metadata and pointers to archive storage in MariaDB.

4. Return ingest result including `article_id` and status.

Idempotency

- Use content hash or `site_id+url` deterministic keys to ensure duplicate ingestion is avoided.

Observability

- Emit `ingest_total`, `ingest_errors`, `ingest_latency` metrics.

Testing

- Unit tests for payload validation and DB writes.

- Integration tests with local Chroma instance (or a mocked vector store) for embedding persistence.
