# Feature: Full Article Pipeline (feat/full_pipeline)

## Overview

This feature unifies the full end-to-end article pipeline into a single documented flow and includes the runtime
configuration, gating, and observability required to safely synthesize and publish articles. It builds on the
`feat/article_creation` work (ClusterFetcher, Analyst, Fact-Checker, Reasoning, Synthesizer, Critic, Chief Editor) and
extends it with operational guidance, integration tests, and deployment considerations.

This document is intended to be the canonical reference for the full pipeline delivered on the `feat/full_pipeline`
branch.

---

## Goals

- Provide an audited, traceable, and gate-able synthesis pipeline for clustered news articles.

- Ensure synthesized drafts undergo mandatory per-article fact-checking and post-synthesis fact-checking before publish.

- Support both persistence strategies (Option A: extend `articles`table, Option B:`synthesized_articles` table) and a database-backed job store.

- Expose runtime admin controls via the Dashboard for gating feature flags and persistence method.

- Provide reliable integration tests and CI gating to avoid accidental auto-publish in production.

---

## High-Level Flow

1. Trigger (API, scheduled job, or orbit event) begins a `SYNTHESIZE_CLUSTER` job.

1. Pre-flight: Web crawl & scrape — the pipeline starts here. `CrawlerEngine`(`agents/crawler/crawler_engine.py`) or
   the `GenericSiteCrawler` discovers article URLs, applies paywall detection and initial heuristics, then calls the
   `memory`agent (`/ingest_article`) to persist candidate articles. The earliest decision is whether a page qualifies
   as a valid article via `agents/crawler/extraction.extract_article_content()` (word count, text/html ratio),
   `skip_ingest`(paywalled), and`needs_review` flags.
0.5. Scheduling & budgets: Crawls are orchestrated by the scheduler script `scripts/ops/run_crawl_schedule.py` which
builds crawl windows from `config/crawl_schedule.yaml`and optionally loads per-site`config/crawl_profiles`. The
scheduler manages budgets, target articles per hour, and adaptive Crawl4AI runs; it emits Prometheus metrics (e.g.,
`justnews_crawler_scheduler_*`). This is the canonical production entrypoint for scheduled crawling and influences pre-
flight gating and ingestion volumes.

1. `ClusterFetcher` collects deduplicated articles for the given cluster.

1. `Analyst`runs per-article claim extraction and a per-article`source_fact_check`using`FactCheckerEngine`.

1. `Reasoning`agent receives the`AnalysisReport`and produces a`reasoning_plan` with prioritized sources, outline, and claims.

1. `Synthesizer`constructs a draft using the`reasoning_plan`and`Analyst`outputs and returns a`DraftArticle` structure.

1. `Critic` reviews the draft for policy and style; the draft is then sent through a mandatory draft-level fact-check.

1. If the draft passes fact-check and Critic constraints, and publishing gates allow, the article is auto-published or queued for Chief Editor review.

1. On publish the system records `is_published`,`published_at`, updates Chroma embeddings, and logs tracing/metrics.

Notes:

- `min_fact_check_percent_for_synthesis` controls whether a cluster proceeds to synthesis at all.

- `require_draft_fact_check_pass_for_publish`controls whether`draft_fact_check` can block publishing.

- `chief_editor_review_required` forces HITL review independent of fact-check status.

---

## Major Components

- `agents/cluster_fetcher/ClusterFetcher` — harvests cluster content and normalizes article records.

- `agents/crawler/CrawlerEngine`&`GenericSiteCrawler` — initial webcrawl, scraping and article extraction. They apply
  a multi-tier extraction pipeline (`agents/crawler/extraction.py`) and simple heuristics that mark`needs_review` when
  the content is short (below `ARTICLE_MIN_WORDS`) or has a low text-to-HTML ratio (`ARTICLE_MIN_TEXT_HTML_RATIO`).
  Paywall detection and `skip_ingest` are used to avoid ingesting behind-paywall pages unless explicitly permitted.

- `agents/analyst/AnalystEngine`— extracts claims, runs per-article fact checks, and outputs`AnalysisReport`with`source_fact_checks`and`cluster_fact_check_summary`.

- `agents/reasoning/Reasoning`— converts`AnalysisReport`into a`reasoning_plan` used to guide synthesis.

- `agents/synthesizer/SynthesizerEngine` — synthesizes the article draft from the plan, records model traces, and creates a DB-backed job when async.

- `agents/critic` — policy validation and editorial guideline checks.

- `agents/fact_checker/FactCheckerEngine`— claim verification for both pre-flight (`source_fact_check`) and post-synthesis draft checks.

- `agents/chief_editor` — HITL queue and review/publish APIs.

- `database`migrations 004/005/006 — schema changes for extended`articles`, new`synthesized_articles`, and job store.

- `scripts/ops/run_crawl_schedule.py` — scheduler and orchestrator for large-scale crawls. It builds schedules from
  `config/crawl_schedule.yaml`, enforces budgets, publishes Prometheus textfile metrics, and submits crawler jobs. This
  script is the canonical production entrypoint for scheduled crawling and should be used in production timers and CI
  smoke tests.

## Admin Controls & Dashboard

The Dashboard offers a small Admin UI for runtime toggles (under `Settings -> Publishing`) with these options:

- `Require draft fact-check pass for publish`— set`agents.publishing.require_draft_fact_check_pass_for_publish`.

- `Require chief editor review`— set`agents.publishing.chief_editor_review_required`.

- `Synthesized article storage`— set`system.persistence.synthesized_article_storage`with choices:`extend`|`new_table`.

Endpoints:

- `GET /admin/get_publishing_config` — returns runtime flags and persistence choice.

- `POST /admin/set_publishing_config`— sets config via the`ConfigurationManager` and persists when requested.

- Authentication: `GET`and`POST` admin endpoints support two modes and will accept either:
  1. A legacy static API key via `Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_API_KEY>`or`X-Admin-API-Key: <key>` (suitable for simple/local deployments), or
  1. A role-based JWT Bearer token (when `ADMIN_API_KEY`is not set). The token must validate (`verify_token`) and the user must have`role=admin`.

Implementation note: the dashboard uses a runtime import of `agents.common.auth_models` so tests can monkeypatch
`verify_token`and`get_user_by_id`. A recent fix ensures the`GET /admin/get_publishing_config` codepath properly
extracts and verifies JWTs — invalid tokens now correctly return HTTP 401 (the behaviour asserted by
`tests/agents/dashboard/test_admin_jwt_auth.py`).

- Audit log: admin changes are appended to `logs/audit/publishing_config_changes.jsonl` for traceability. When admin
  JWTs are used those admin actions include `user_id`/`username` in the audit entry; we recommend extending audit
  entries to capture requestor identity and IP address for richer traceability (tracked as a follow-up).

- Reload endpoint protection: the common `/admin/reload`endpoint can now be registered as`require_admin=True` which
  enforces the same admin auth (static `ADMIN_API_KEY`or`role=admin` JWT) when used by agents like the dashboard. The
  dashboard uses `require_admin=True`by default for`/admin/reload` to prevent unauthorised runtime reloads.

Operator notes:

- To enable admin authentication set `ADMIN_API_KEY`in`/etc/justnews/global.env` or the deployment environment. The
  endpoints will require the header: `Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_API_KEY>`or`X-Admin-API-Key: <ADMIN_API_KEY>`. If
  you prefer per-user authorization and auditing, omit the `ADMIN_API_KEY` and enforce role-based JWTs via the
  `agents/common/auth_api` endpoints instead.

- Tests: Add `tests/agents/dashboard/test_admin_jwt_auth.py` which validates JWT admin flows for
  `/admin/get_publishing_config`,`/admin/set_publishing_config`and`/admin/reload` (the latter validates admin auth
  succeeds even if no reload handlers are registered, proving auth is enforced).

- Add to Systemd env example: `infrastructure/systemd/examples/dashboard.env.example`: set`ADMIN_API_KEY` for the
  dashboard to enforce admin authentication. Rotate the key regularly and use an audit log retention policy in
  `monitoring/`. For production, prefer a JWT-based model and short-lived tokens.

- For production rollouts prefer an internal-only API gateway that enforces authentication and mTLS instead of a single
  static key; this is especially important for multi-user environments. Rotate keys using the `ConfigurationManager` and
  store audit logs in `logs/audit` (retention managed by infra).

Security: These endpoints should be protected in production (internal IP, API key or service-token-based access).

Public-facing products:

- Published Website — the UI served under `agents/dashboard/public_website.html`and accessible at`/` is the real-time,
  curated site. It should use the lightweight `GET /api/public/articles` endpoint (already present in the Dashboard
  `include_public_api`) to fetch recent, balanced, and fact-checked article summaries for display. This product is
  focused on news readership and should avoid exposing full traceability metadata for every article.

- Public Research API — `/api/public/search/*` endpoints (semantic/text/hybrid search) are the research-facing API.
  Scholars and journalists use these endpoints to query the full traceable corpus (includes vector metadata and
  similarity scores). This API offers more context and is intended for analysis with clear terms of usage and rate
  limiting.

## Persisted Data & Traceability

Modeling choices are documented in `feat_article_creation.md`, but the pipeline enforces full traceability: every
synthesized article draft stores metadata like `synth_trace`,`critic_result`,`analysis_summary`,`source_fact_checks`,
`reasoning_plan_id`, and`fact_check_trace`.

Knowledge Graph (KG) storage: The system now uses a DB-backed Knowledge Graph by default (MariaDB tables `entities` and
`article_entities`created in migration 007). The`agents/archive` code will persist extracted entities and
article->entity links to MariaDB for scale, queryability and auditing. A file- backed KG (legacy) remains available as a
fallback if `KG_BACKEND=file` is set — this is intended only for lightweight local development or when MariaDB is
temporarily unavailable.

Chroma: store `is_synthesized` metadata on embeddings to help retrieval & housekeeping.

Raw HTML archive & retention: The extractor (`agents/crawler/extraction.py`) saves raw HTML artefacts to
`archive_storage/raw_html/` for forensic analysis, re-extraction, and model/data backfills. Ensure retention & backfill
policies are documented and a clear reprocessing path exists: crawl -> raw_html -> extraction -> ingest.

Migration summary:

- `004_add_synthesis_fields.sql`— adds synth fields to`articles` for Option A.

- `005_create_synthesized_articles_table.sql` — Option B table layout.

- `006_create_synthesizer_jobs_table.sql` — DB-backed job store to ensure durable async jobs.

---

## Fact-Checking & Critic Policy

- Fact-checking is mandatory: both per-source (`source_fact_checks`) and draft-level.

- `SourceFactCheck`verdict mapping:`>= 0.8 => passed`,`0.6-0.79 => needs_review`,`< 0.6 => failed` (default thresholds — configurable).

- Draft `fact_check_status`can be`pending`,`passed`,`needs_review`,`failed`. Auto-publish requires`passed` unless the chief editor overrides.

- Critic policies with severity `block`or`must_edit`will prevent publishing and escalate to HITL. Critic results are stored as`critic_result` JSON with detailed messages.

- Training-forward & HITL labeling: The HITL staging service (`agents/hitl_service`) collects reviewer decisions and can
  forward labels to the `training_system`when`HITL_TRAINING_FORWARD_AGENT` is configured. The integration test suite
  should assert that labeled HITL outputs can be exported and used to retrain extractors/classifiers in
  `training_system`.

- Evidence audit integration: If `EVIDENCE_AUDIT_BASE_URL` is set and accessible it should be used as a canonical
  evidence provenance store. If unavailable, fact-checkers must conservatively default to `needs_review` rather than
  `passed` to avoid unsafe auto-publishing.

---

## Crawl & Ingest Details (Where the pipeline starts) 🔎

The very beginning of the pipeline is the web crawl and scrape stage — this is where candidate pages are accepted,
rejected, or flagged for review.

- Crawler: `agents/crawler/crawler_engine.py`coordinates site-specific strategies (`ultra_fast`,`ai_enhanced`,
  `generic`) and optionally delegates to`crawl4ai`crawlers.`GenericSiteCrawler` fetches homepages, extracts article
  links with `_extract_article_links()`, fetches article HTML and runs`_build_article()`.

- Extraction & heuristics: `agents/crawler/extraction.py` runs a multi-tier extraction (Trafilatura -> Readability ->
  jusText -> plain-css driven fallback). It computes `word_count`and`boilerplate_ratio` (text-to-HTML ratio) and sets
  `needs_review`when thresholds are not met. The environment flags`ARTICLE_MIN_WORDS` and
  `ARTICLE_MIN_TEXT_HTML_RATIO` are used to tune this behaviour.

- Paywalls & skip policy: A `PaywallDetector`can mark`paywall_flag`and`skip_ingest`. The crawler records paywall
  statistics and may trigger `record_paywall_detection()` if dominated by paywalled content. Paywalled pages are not
  ingested by default.

- HITL & review flow: Pre-ingestion candidates that are borderline can be submitted to the HITL queue via
  `_submit_hitl_candidates()` for editorial review before ingest. This is useful for novel or low-confidence pages.

- Ingestion: `_ingest_articles()`in`CrawlerEngine`calls the`memory`agent's`ingest_article`tool (`POST
  /ingest_article`in`agents/memory/main.py`). The memory agent handles upserts into the`sources` table and finalizes
  `articles`insertion; it also sets`ingestion_status`as`new`,`duplicate`, or`error` and includes
  `extraction_metadata` for downstream analysers.

These early decisions - whether a page is valid, paywalled, or a candidate for review - strongly influence which
articles become available for downstream clustering, analysis, fact-check, and ultimately synthesis.

---

## Job Store & Async APIs

- `POST /api/v1/articles/synthesize` (async) returns a job_id.

- `GET /api/v1/articles/synthesize/{job_id}`polls the job state and returns preview +`critic_result`.

- Job store: `agents/synthesizer/job_store.py` supports in-memory or DB persistence. Default for production: DB-based table migration 006.

- Retry & job recovery: DB-backed job store must be used in production to handle restarts, retries and backoffs.
  Integration tests should validate that state persists through agent restarts and that scheduled retries follow retry
  policies in `agents/synthesizer/job_store.py`.

---

## Tests & CI

- Unit tests: policy tests of `Analyst`, claim extraction, reasoner, and synthesizer primitives.

- Integration tests (integration marker): Analyst + Fact-Checker + Reasoning + Synthesis + Critic with LLM/Chroma mocked.

- E2E gating tests: ensure admin toggles block or allow publish appropriately, with simulated `chief_editor` approvals.

- CI: add an `integration` runner that executes integration tests in a separate workflow (optionally on a runner with MariaDB + Chroma).

---

## Scripts

- `scripts/synthesize_cluster.py`: local debug wrapper for`POST /synthesize_and_publish`.

- `scripts/fact_check_cluster.py`: debug fact-check for cluster articles.

- `scripts/reason_cluster.py`: preview the`reasoning_plan` for a cluster.

- `scripts/ops/apply_synthesis_migration.sh`: audited apply for DB migrations 004–006.

- `scripts/ops/run_crawl_schedule.py`: schedule orchestration for crawls — builds windows from
  `config/crawl_schedule.yaml`, enforces budgets, and publishes scheduler metrics to Prometheus via textfile exports.
  Use this script for production scheduled crawling and CI smoke tests.

- `scripts/chroma_diagnose.py`/`scripts/chroma_bootstrap.py`: helper scripts to ensure the Chroma tenant and
  'articles' collection are available for the memory agent; include these in the E2E integration docs.

---

## Observability & Metrics

- Log: `synthesis_job_id`,`cluster_id`,`draft_id`,`model_version`,`start`/`end`times,`critic_result`,`fact_check_status`,`published`boolean.

- Metrics: `synthesis_jobs_started`,`synthesis_jobs_published`,`analysis_latency`,`reasoning_latency`,`fact_check_pass_rate`.

- Scheduler metrics: `justnews_crawler_scheduler_*`and adaptive metrics (`justnews_crawler_scheduler_adaptive_*`)
  produced by `scripts/ops/run_crawl_schedule.py`and`agents/crawler/adaptive_metrics`.

- Rate Limiting: Public API endpoints (`/api/public/*`) are protected by an in-memory rate limiter for ad-hoc
  deployments; production deployments should configure `REDIS_URL` so the router uses a Redis-backed rate limiter
  (consistent across replicas). The search router enforces `max_requests=20` per minute by default for public API
  requests. Unit tests exist in `tests/agents/dashboard/test_rate_limiting.py` to check both in-memory and Redis-backed
  behavior (with a fake Redis object in tests).

- Use Prometheus and Grafana dashboards to monitor the above metrics.

---

## Deployment, Rollout & Safety

- Disable auto-publish by default for new categories. Clear feature toggles enable limited production rollout with Chief Editor review enforced.

- Start with an internal-only rollout for a narrow category; after validation, expand to canary and full production.

- Make sure the Evidence Audit service is accessible in production; otherwise, any fact-check downstream errors should default to `needs_review`.

- Retention & Backfill:

- Raw HTML archival in `archive_storage/raw_html/`is the forensic record. Implement retention (cleanup) & backfill scripts in`scripts/ops/` to manage storage and ensure reproducible extraction runs.

- Deprecated components: ultra-fast per-site crawlers (e.g., `agents/sites/bbc_crawler.py`) are kept as stubs and
  flagged for deprecation. The recommended path is to migrate specialized behaviour into `config/crawl_profiles` and the
  `crawl4ai_adapter` so adaptive Crawl4AI is the canonical strategy.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Unit and integration tests pass.

- Drafts are persisted with full traceability and saved into the selected persistence strategy.

- Admin toggles in Dashboard appear and `GET /admin/get_publishing_config` returns correct values.

- `POST /synthesize_and_publish`uses`min_fact_check_percent_for_synthesis`preflight gating and respects`require_draft_fact_check_pass_for_publish`.

- The job store persists job state when DB option is selected and recovers job status after restarts.

## Known Gaps & Action Items (Post-Review)

- CI: The repository now includes a GitHub Actions file `.github/workflows/integration-chroma-mariadb.yml` which spins
  up MariaDB and Chroma and runs a smoke test for `agents.memory` saving articles into Chroma. This ensures
  chroma/mariaDB-based flows are exercised in CI (requires enabling workflows on PRs for feature branch).

## Next steps

- Harden admin endpoints with authentication and auditing.

- Add Chief Editor UI hooks for full HITL publishing.

- Run full E2E tests on an integration runner using MariaDB and Chroma.
